### DAY 3: Social Proof & Value Demo

[Name],

Quick question: How much time does your team spend copying/pasting between ChatGPT and your actual work?

Our beta customer [Similar Company] was burning 15+ hours/week on exactly this. Now they:
- Process 300% more queries with our API integration
- White-label our AI for their own clients
- Generated an extra $50k revenue last month

**Want to see exactly how?** I can show you their setup in a 10-minute screen share.

## HIGH-URGENCY TRIGGERS

### Trigger: User completes valuable action in trial
**Subject: 🚀 [Name], this is exactly why companies pay $199/month**

What you just did typically takes our Business tier customers from 2 hours → 10 minutes.

At $199/month, that's an ROI of 2,400% if you do it just twice a week.

**Want to lock this in?** Founding customer pricing ends soon.

[Upgrade to Business - 50% off first 3 months]

### Trigger: User hits usage limits in trial
**Subject: You've maxed out your trial limits (that's actually great news)**

[Name],

You've hit your trial usage limits - which means you're seeing serious value.

**Good news:** Business tier customers get 10x the limits + unlimited API access.

**Even better news:** I can unlock unlimited access for the rest of your trial right now.

Want me to flip the switch? Just reply "YES" and I'll upgrade you immediately.

## CONVERSATION STARTERS FOR PHONE FOLLOW-UPS

"Hi [Name], I saw you've been really active in your trial. What's working best for you so far?"

"Quick question: what's the biggest bottleneck with your current AI workflow that you're hoping we can solve?"

"I noticed you tried [specific feature]. Most companies that use that see immediate ROI. Are you seeing similar results?"

"What would need to happen for this to be a no-brainer purchase for your team?"

"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about how your team uses AI, what would it be?"

## OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

### "We're already using ChatGPT/Claude"
"That's exactly why you'll love this. Think of us as ChatGPT Pro Max - all the capability you know, plus API access, team collaboration, custom integrations, and white-label options that ChatGPT simply doesn't offer businesses like yours."

### "Need to think about it"
"I totally understand. What specifically do you need to think through? Happy to help you work through any concerns right now."

### "Budget/pricing concerns"
"What if I told you our founding customers typically see ROI within their first month? [Specific example]. Plus, as a founding customer, you're looking at $99/month instead of $199. That's less than what most companies spend on their team's morning coffee."

### "Need to check with team"
"Smart approach. What questions will they have? I can prepare some materials that'll make that conversation easier for you."
