# DuoTrader Market Research - Jan 27, 2026

## Key Pain Points Discovered

### 1. High Fees Eating Profits ⚡ CRITICAL
- "gains I was making on bullx disappeared due to high fees"
- "people set their priority fees too high for their small volume trades"
- Users switching platforms specifically for "lower fees"
- Example: axiom → shotgun.fun, bullx → sniperoo

### 2. Multi-Tab Inefficiency 
Successful traders using complex manual workflow:
- Tab 1: Photon (trading)
- Tab 2: Dex screener (charts)
- Tab 3: Rug pull checker
- Manual analysis of: liquidity, makers, candle patterns, highs/lows

### 3. Manual Profit-Taking
- "sell within 10-20 mins and take profits in 20-25% chunks"
- No automation for this critical process
- Missing opportunities while manually managing exits

### 4. Bot Competition
- "bringing a knife to a bot fight"
- "Less than 5% of wallets trade memecoins profitably"
- Humans losing to algorithmic trading

## What Actually Works

### Successful Tools/Strategies:
1. **Banana Pro** - "lietarlly the fastest" with filtered wallet tracking
2. **Custom trackers** - One profitable trader built custom "lock tracker dex tracker and rely 95% on it"
3. **Wallet following** - Track successful traders automatically
4. **Lock detection** - Identify when liquidity is locked (safety signal)
