**Budget-Conscious, High-Impact** - Uses pure CSS animations, web fonts, and emojis instead of expensive graphics, while still creating a premium feel.

**Personality-Driven** - Every element has character, from the bouncing gremlins to the glowing CEO aura. It feels like a real AI personality, not corporate fluff.
