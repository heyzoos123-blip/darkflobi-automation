## LINKEDIN OUTREACH SEQUENCES

### SEQUENCE 1: The "Better Than ChatGPT" Approach

**Message 1: Connection Request**
"Hi [Name], noticed your team at [Company] is doing impressive work with AI. I'd love to connect and share something that might interest you."

**Message 2: Value Proposition (Send 1 hour after connection)**
"[Name], quick question: is your team currently using ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro for business work?

I ask because we've built something specifically for teams like yours - think 'ChatGPT Enterprise' but available now, with API access, team collaboration, and white-label features.

Worth a 10-minute conversation to show you how [Similar Company] increased their AI efficiency by 300% last month?"

**Message 3: Social Proof (Send if no response after 2 days)**
"[Name], just saw [Competitor/Similar Company] announce they're offering AI services to their clients. 

They're using our platform to white-label AI capabilities - something impossible with ChatGPT/Claude.

Thought you might be interested in how they're generating an extra $25k/month with this approach.

5-minute call to show you their setup?"

**Message 4: Urgency Close (Send after 3 days)**
"[Name], I'm closing our founding customer program this Friday.

Current members locked in Business tier features at 50% off ($99 instead of $199) for 3 months.

If AI is strategic for [Company], this might be worth exploring before spots fill up.

Quick call today or tomorrow?"

### SEQUENCE 2: The "API Access" Angle

**Message 1:**
"Hi [Name], saw that [Company] is building some innovative solutions. Do you ever find yourself wishing you had proper API access to AI models for your applications?"

**Message 2:**
"[Name], most companies I talk to are frustrated by ChatGPT's API limitations and Claude's enterprise waiting lists.

We've built a solution that gives you immediate API access to advanced AI models, plus team collaboration and white-label options.

[Similar Company] integrated our API and launched an AI feature for their customers in 48 hours.

Worth a quick demo to see if this could accelerate your roadmap?"

**Message 3:**
"Just checking - did you see my message about API access? 

I'm asking because we're accepting only 12 more companies into our founding customer program (ends Friday), and I'd hate for [Company] to miss out if this could solve your AI integration challenges."

---

### SEQUENCE 3: The "White-Label Revenue" Play

**Message 1:**
"[Name], quick question: have you considered offering AI services to your clients, but been blocked by the lack of white-label options?"

**Message 2:**
"Most agencies we work with were in the same boat. They wanted to offer AI to clients but couldn't with ChatGPT/Claude.

[Agency Name] now generates an extra $30k/month offering white-labeled AI services using our platform.

Their clients think it's [Agency Name]'s proprietary AI.

15 minutes to show you their exact setup?"

## EMAIL OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### COLD EMAIL 1: The Direct Value Play
**Subject: [Company Name]: Turn your AI costs into revenue**

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How much is your team spending on AI tools monthly? (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, etc.)

Most companies tell me $200-500/month across their team.

**What if those same costs could generate revenue instead?**

[Similar Company] switched to our Business tier platform ($199/month) and now:
- White-labels AI services to clients (+$25k/month revenue)
- Has full API access (no more copy/paste workflows)  
- Team collaboration features ChatGPT doesn't offer
- Custom integrations with their existing tools

**Net result:** Their $199 AI cost became a $25k revenue center.

Worth 10 minutes to see their exact setup?

### COLD EMAIL 2: The Compliance/Privacy Angle
**Subject: AI for [Company Name] without the data privacy concerns**

[Name],

Using ChatGPT for business work but concerned about data privacy?

Most companies face this dilemma: powerful AI capabilities vs. data security.

**We solved it.**

Our Business tier platform gives you:
- Enterprise-grade data privacy (your data stays private)
- Advanced AI capabilities that outperform ChatGPT for business use
- Full API access and team collaboration
- White-label options for client work

**[Company]** made the switch last month and their compliance team approved it immediately.

15-minute demo to show you the privacy features?

### COLD EMAIL 3: The ROI Calculator
**Subject: ROI Calculator: Is your AI setup costing you money?**

[Name],

Quick math problem:

If your team spends 2 hours/week on tasks that our AI platform could do in 20 minutes, what's that worth?

**At $75/hour (conservative for [Industry]):**
- Current cost: 2 hours × $75 = $150/week
- Our platform cost: 20 minutes × $75 = $25/week  
- **Weekly savings: $125**
- **Monthly savings: $500**
- **Annual savings: $6,000**

Our Business tier costs $199/month. **Net annual savings: $3,612.**

Plus you get API access, white-label features, and team collaboration that ChatGPT simply can't offer.

**Want to verify this math with a 10-minute demo?**

[Similar Company] made the switch and went from spending $300/month on AI to generating $25k/month in new revenue by white-labeling AI services to their clients.
