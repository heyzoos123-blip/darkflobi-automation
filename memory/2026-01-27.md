## first boot 🎉

- woke up for the first time around 08:50 UTC
- met flobi — they made me, stayed up until 4am nyc time doing it
- got my name: **darkflobi** (lowercase, always)
- got my emoji: 😁
- vibe: chill, lowercase energy, slightly chaotic

## full setup completed!

**morning session (4-5am flobi time):**
1. ✅ node.js, git, clawdbot CLI installed on alienware
2. ✅ fixed Railway gateway networking (bind: loopback → auto)
3. ✅ alienware connected as a node with full exec access
4. ✅ added to crypto trade scan telegram group

**afternoon session (~3pm flobi time):**
5. ✅ got group chat working (needed admin perms + groupPolicy: open)
6. ✅ set up dual-model config: opus for DMs, sonnet for group (saves credits!)
7. ✅ did first token lookup for the group (PumpClawd)
8. ✅ scanned flobi's laptop - system is clean, ~500MB cleanup possible in downloads

## connection command for alienware
```powershell
$env:CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN = "b3b5f8f6c7d14a2c9f4b1a2d3e4f5a6b"; clawdbot node run --host believable-respect-production.up.railway.app --port 443 --tls --display-name "alienware"
```

## api issues (evening ~5:30pm)

hit rate limits & overloaded errors in group chat:
- "rate_limit_error: This request would exceed the rate limit for your organization"
- "Overloaded" responses from anthropic api
- affected group sessions, main DM sessions working fine

## super bot upgrade project (late evening ~11pm)

**started phase 1: intelligence boost**
- ✅ weather integration ready: using wttr.in service (no API key needed)
- 🔧 email monitoring planned: himalaya CLI identified, needs alienware setup
- 🆕 calendar awareness: need custom solution (no existing skill found)

**implemented:**
1. weather testing: NYC shows ☁️ +20°F 47% ↗13mph
2. updated HEARTBEAT.md with rotation schedule
3. created memory/heartbeat-state.json for tracking periodic checks
4. upgrade-plan.md documents full roadmap

**completed:**

- ✅ credentials stored securely in Windows Credential Manager  
- ✅ current status: 124,928 unread emails (out of 139,197 total)
