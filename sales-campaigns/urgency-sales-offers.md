### 🎤 URGENCY SALES CALL SCRIPTS

#### Opening for Urgent Prospects:
"[Name], I'm calling because you're one of [X] people in our final batch of founding customers, and I wanted to make sure you didn't miss out on something that could be game-changing for [Company]."

#### Creating Time Pressure:
"Here's the situation: We're capping founding customers at 25 total. We're at 23 right now, and I have 3 other demos scheduled today. The program closes Friday regardless, but realistically, we'll be full by Thursday evening."

#### Urgency Close:
"I can hold a spot for you for the next 2 hours while you [check with team/review budget/whatever they need], but after that, I need to release it to the waitlist. Fair enough?"

#### Objection to Urgency:
**"This feels rushed"**
"I totally understand that feeling. The urgency isn't artificial - we genuinely need to cap the program to provide the level of personal attention we promised. Would it help if I showed you the founding customer Slack where you can see the direct dev team interaction happening?"
