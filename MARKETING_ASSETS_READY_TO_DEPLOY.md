🧵 I've been building an AI platform in stealth for 6 months. 

Going public today. Here's what makes it different:

1/12
```

```
Most people pay $20/month for ChatGPT Plus and get:
- Just GPT-4 access
- Basic chat interface  
- No API access
- Limited document features

I thought: "What if we did this better?"

2/12
```

```
So we built ClawdBot with:

🧠 5 premium AI models (Claude Opus, GPT-5, Gemini Pro)
📄 Advanced document editing
🔌 Full API access
⚡ Developer-grade performance
💰 Starting at just $29/month

3/12
```

```
The crazy part? 

We're cheaper than ChatGPT Plus but give you 5x more value.

It's like having Claude Pro + ChatGPT Plus + Gemini Advanced in one tool, for half the price.

4/12
```

```
Some features I'm most proud of:

• Multi-model conversations (switch between Claude and GPT mid-chat)
• Real document collaboration (not just text files)
• Webhook integrations for automation
• Clean, fast UI that doesn't suck

5/12
```

```
We soft-launched to 50 beta users last month.

The feedback has been incredible:

"Finally, an AI tool that doesn't treat me like a basic user"

"Saved me $40/month and got better results"

"The API access alone is worth it"

6/12
```

```
Here's what our users are building:

• Marketing agencies automating client reports
• Developers building AI features into their apps  
• Consultants creating proposals 10x faster
• Content creators scaling their output

7/12
```

```
Honestly, we could charge way more.

But I wanted to make premium AI accessible to everyone, not just enterprises with massive budgets.

That's why we start at $29/month (vs $60+ for equivalent features elsewhere).

8/12
```

```
We're doing a launch week special:

🎉 7-day free trial (no credit card)
🎉 50% off first month for first 100 customers
🎉 Lifetime access to new models we add

This ends in 48 hours.

9/12
```

```
If you're tired of:
- Paying for multiple AI subscriptions
- Limited features in consumer tools
- Waiting for new model access

ClawdBot might be perfect for you.

Try it free for 7 days, no strings attached.

If you don't love it, cancel and owe nothing.

But I think you'll be surprised by how much more you can get done.

### LinkedIn Launch Post
```
🚀 After 6 months of development, I'm excited to introduce ClawdBot - an AI platform that's changing how professionals work with AI.

**The Problem:** Most AI tools are built for consumers, not professionals. You get limited features, pay multiple subscriptions, and can't integrate with your workflow.

**Our Solution:** A single platform with 5 premium AI models, developer-grade features, and transparent pricing starting at $29/month.

**What makes ClawdBot different:**
✅ Claude Opus, GPT-5, Gemini Pro in one place
✅ Advanced document editing and collaboration  
✅ Full API access for integration
✅ Built by developers, for professionals

We've been testing with 50 companies over the past month. The results speak for themselves:

• Marketing teams cutting content creation time by 60%
• Developers building AI features in days, not weeks
• Consultants delivering proposals 10x faster

**Launch Week Special (48 hours only):**
- 7-day free trial, no credit card required
- 50% off first month for early adopters
- Lifetime access to new models

If you're spending $20+ on ChatGPT Plus or managing multiple AI subscriptions, this could save you time and money.

Title: Launched my AI tool this week - here's what I learned about competing with ChatGPT

Hey entrepreneurs! 

Just launched ClawdBot after 6 months of development. It's an AI platform that gives you multiple premium models (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini) in one place for less than you'd pay for ChatGPT Plus alone.

**Key learnings from launch week:**

1. **Price anchor everything against ChatGPT Plus** ($20/month) - makes our $29 starter plan feel like a steal

2. **Developer features matter** - API access and webhooks are huge differentiators for business users

3. **Free trials convert like crazy** - 15% trial-to-paid so far (industry average is 2-5%)

4. **Multiple models = competitive moat** - users love switching between Claude and GPT mid-conversation

**The numbers so far (5 days in):**
- 200+ trial signups  
- 15 paying customers
- $650 MRR 
- $42 average customer acquisition cost

**Biggest mistake:** Tried to target everyone initially. Now focusing on professionals who already pay for AI tools.

**Next month goal:** $4,900 MRR

Happy to answer questions! Also offering free trials to this community if you want to check it out.

Title: Built a multi-model AI platform - Claude Opus + GPT-5 + Gemini Pro in one interface

Hey r/AI! 

Spent the last 6 months building ClawdBot - a platform that lets you access multiple premium AI models in one clean interface.

**Technical details:**
- Built with Next.js 16 + TypeScript
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Real-time model switching mid-conversation  
- Advanced document editing with AI collaboration
- Full REST API for integrations
- Webhook support for automation

**Models integrated:**
✅ Claude Opus & Haiku (Anthropic)

✅ Gemini Pro & Flash (Google)
✅ Working on xAI Grok integration

**Cool features:**
- Compare responses across models instantly
- Chain prompts between different models
- Advanced document templates and automation
- Usage analytics and cost tracking

The response has been incredible - 15% trial-to-paid conversion rate in first week.

Subject: How [Company] saved 20 hours this week with ClawdBot

Hi [Name],

Hope you're enjoying ClawdBot! I wanted to share a quick case study that might spark some ideas for your own workflow.

**Case Study: Marketing Agency Automation**

Sarah from BrandCraft Agency was spending 15-20 hours per week creating:
- Client reports
- Social media content  
- Email campaigns
- Proposal documents

**Her ClawdBot workflow now:**
1. Uploads client data to our document system
2. Uses Claude Opus for strategic analysis
3. Switches to GPT-5 for creative content
4. Gemini Pro handles data visualization
5. Exports everything as branded PDFs

**Result:** Same quality work in 3 hours instead of 20.

**Savings:** 17 hours per week = $1,700 in billable time (at $100/hr)
**Cost:** $79/month ClawdBot Pro subscription
**ROI:** 2,150% monthly

**What could you automate with 17 extra hours per week?**
